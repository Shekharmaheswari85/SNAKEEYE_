For testing flask application we use <pytest>

after executing the docker image <<docker-compose up>>
we have to type this command in the new command line
docker-compose exec website py.test snakeeyes/tests
for Cov report file we user pytest-cov

docker-compose exec website py.test --cov-report term-missing --cov snakeeyes


--cov snakeeyes because we want to test the whole code base itself

term-missing  ->> term--->output the terms in the terminal and missing means head the line no where the file is being missing



for static analysis of our flask application we use the flake8

docker-compose exec website flake8 .

for excluding a perticular py file from the codebase

docker-compose exec website flake8 . --exclude __init__.py
